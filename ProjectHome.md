There seems to a lot of Windows applications which will display certain information to your screen, but they are either chock-full of eye candy (widgets?) or are limited by the programmer to what they want to display; I wanted something a little more flexible. GeekTool will run any command-line program and display it's output to the desktop. You can also specify regular expressions for the output, so that only the information you want is displayed.
